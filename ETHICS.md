# Ethical Guidelines

- **Purpose:** Assistively flag likely manipulations to support human reviewersâ€”not to provide final judgments.
- **Fairness:** Track false positives/negatives by subgroup (when ethically collected). Avoid optimizing only global accuracy.
- **Transparency:** Provide visual & textual explanations; document model limits in `MODEL_CARD.md`.
- **Human Oversight:** Keep a human-in-the-loop for any consequential decisions.
- **Harm Avoidance:** Bias toward low-confidence warnings rather than definitive claims.
- **Security & Abuse:** Prevent repurposing the tool for surveillance or targeted harassment.
